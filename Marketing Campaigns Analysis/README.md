### Project Title:
### Marketing Analytics Dashboard in Power BI
### Project Overview
In this project, I developed a comprehensive marketing analytics dashboard using Power BI to visualise and analyse customer engagement and campaign performance. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer spending, campaign effectiveness, and website visits, and it is supposed to be driving the next decisions of the marketing department, customer management team and retail-buyers. . 
### Key Objectives
Analyse customer behaviour to optimise marketing, customer service and buying strategies.
Visualise key metrics such as purchases per web visit, churn rate, and campaign acceptance rates.
Enable stakeholders to easily interact with the data through slicers and drill-through functionality to check data by country. 
### Data Sources
I used this data set to learn Power BI, and I decided to dedicate to it a full project because the data allows for a lot of considerations and working on.
They are the fictitious sales data from a CRM system, including customer IDs, purchase history, and campaign responses.
There are also Web analytics data capturing customer interactions on the website and information about point of sales and revenue by product category.
### Key Features
- Unpivoted Data Structure: Transformed campaign data for better analysis, allowing for insights across multiple campaigns without duplication, created custom columns to analyse customer behaviour by age group and calculating churn rate.
- Calculated Measures: Created DAX measures for metrics such as average purchase value, total revenue by product category, purchases by sale channel, campaigns response rate, churn rate. 
- Interactive Dashboard: Designed an interactive dashboard with drill-through capabilities, enabling users to explore campaign performance by country and age group.
- Visualisations: Utilised various Power BI visualisations (bar charts, gauges, cards) to present data in a clear and informative manner.
### Technical Skills Used
- Power BI: Data modelling, DAX calculations, and report design.
- Data Transformation: Unpivoting data and creating calculated columns in Power Query.
 -Data Visualization: Creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards.
### Impact
This project provides actionable insights to help improve marketing strategies and customer engagement, leading to increased conversion rates and more effective targeting of campaigns. It may also be addressed to buyers and operations for reevaluation of customer targets and product categories. 
### Future Enhancements
In a real situation, there will be integration of real-time data with a mobile dashboard for monitoring campaigns or sales. Considering I can't get any extra information and data I can still produce an attrition predictive model and a customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms. Looking to expand this project by integrating real-time data and implementing advanced analytics features such as predictive modelling.
