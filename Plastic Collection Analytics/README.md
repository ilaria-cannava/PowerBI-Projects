I am a data collaborator for Unwaste.io, a UK-based social enterprise focused on plastic waste management. As part of the selection process, I was tasked with creating a data visualization using the tech tools of my choice, based on data collected through their app, Wastebase, which is publicly available on Kaggle. Having recently learned Power BI, I created a report aimed at the general public to showcase Wastebaseâ€™s data, activities, and potential.

Below are some snapshots of the report, which includes interactive maps, scorecards displaying total items collected, slicers for filtering data by country, measures to calculate the volume of plastic waste collected, dynamic images to represent these volumes, and bar charts highlighting leaderboards of producers and brands.
