### My Data Journey: Power BI & Beyond

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: mastering data is about more than just one tool. It’s about understanding the data structure and choosing the right tools to visualise, analyse, and communicate the story behind it. The ability to juggle multiple platforms and understand the data is key to unlocking powerful insights, and the ability to adapt to new tools quickly and confidently is essential for navigating a career in data and tech. 

A great opportunity to explore Power BI's potential while gaining confidence in working with KPIs specific to the charity sector was creating this report (I am sharing snapshots of) on Fundraising and Donors for a fictional charity.

What made the transition to Power BI relatively smooth was my solid foundation in data handling, thanks to countless hours spent working with Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and MySQL on various projects for my courses and portfolio.

Always keep an eye on emerging technologies while staying grounded in strong data fundamentals!
